	.SBTTL	VT1802 Overview

;++
;   The VT1802 is a stand alone serial ASCII terminal based on the CDP1802 CPU
; and the Intel 8275 CRT controller.  The VT1802 generates an 80 column by 24
; or 25 line monochrome text display.  The display scan rate is 15.750kHz
; horizontal and 60Hz vertical with either TTL CGA monochrome or analog CVBS
; RS-170 outputs.
;
;   The VT1802 uses a 7x8, 8x8 or 9x8 pixel character font which is stored in
; an external EPROM.  Up to 256 glyphs can be stored in the EPROM, allowing
; for a full upper and lower case ASCII set plus an number of special symbols.
; In addition, the 8275 can generate simple straight line graphics which are
; fully supported by the VT1802.  And lastly, the 8275 supports several
; character attributes including blinking, strikethru, reverse video and 
; highlight which are also implemented by the VT1802.
;
;   The VT1802 uses a CDP1854 UART and a CDP1863 baud rate generator.  It can
; operate at all standard rates from 110 to 9600bps, and can use either CTS/DTR
; hardware flow control or XON/XOFF software flow control.  A PS/2 keyboard is
; used for input, and an AT89C4051 auxiliary processor decodes the PS/2
; prototocol to generate ASCII key codes.  A second CDP1863 is provided to
; generate audio frequencies to drive a speaker and which can play simple
; musical tunes.
;
;   The VT1802 firmware also contains a copy of the RCA BASIC3 interpreter and
; can operate in local mode as a stand alone BASIC computer.  Up to 24K of RAM
; is available to BASIC for storing programs and data, and programs can be
; uploaded to or downloaded from a host computer over the serial port using the
; XMODEM protocol.  The VT1802 BASIC has been extended to include functions
; that allow input and output to be redirected to either the serial port or to
; the PS/2 keyboard and VT display.
;
;   A BASIC PLAY statement allows playing of simple music using the CDP1863
; sound generator, and the BASIC TIME and WAIT functions keep track of the
; time of day using VRTC interrupts.   And lastly, a BASIC KEY function allows
; for non-blocking console input from either the serial port or PS/2 keyboard.

	.SBTTL	"Revision History"

;++
; 001	-- Start by stealing from the Elf2K project!
;
; 002	-- Steal some code from the VIS1802 and Elf2K video card projects.
;
; 003	-- Missing a call to LDCURS in CRET.
;
; 004	-- LDCURS should disable interrupts while loading the 8275.
;
; 005	-- EOFISR does PUSHR(P1) when it should be PUSHR(T1)!!
;
; 006	-- Eliminate the PS/2 keyboard buffer (the APU already has one).
;
; 007	-- Add TEST command to display a test pattern.
;
; 008	-- Add TERM command to test terminal emulation.
;
; 009	-- Changes for the rev B PC boards.
;	    Add support for the DIP switches to set baud and serial format.
;	    Add support for the CDP1863 baud rate generator.
;
; 010	-- Add CTS and XON/XOFF flow control (stolen from VIS).
;
; 011	-- Add support for CDP1863 sound generator.  Use it for the ^G BELL.
;	    Add music player, identical to the VIS1802.
;
; 012	-- VTPUTC needs to return with DF=0 (otherwise CONPUT will loop!).
;
; 013	-- Implement <ESC>r (reverse video) and <ESC>n (normal video) for
;	    compatibility with the VIS1802.  These are just special cases of
;	    the <ESC>Nx field attribute code.
;
; 014	-- Implement <ESC>l to access the 8275 line drawing attributes.
;
; 015	-- Make the pixel clock and cpu clock assembly options.
;
; 016	-- Adjust the timing parameters for 14.31818MHz to give even more
;	    overscan.  This produces a reasonable image on my LCD TV!
;
; 017	-- Implement <ESC>Z (identify) and Control-E (ENQ).  Both return the
;	    sequence <ESC>/K (VT52 w/o copier).
;
; 018	-- Disable interrupts in SCRUP and SCRDWN while we mess with TOPLIN.
;
; 019	-- Change the ROWEND ISR to test for DMAPTR .GE. SCREND .
;
; 020	-- Make VTPUTC trim all characters, EXCEPT the subsequent bytes of
; 	    escape sequences, to 7 bits.
;
; 021	-- Firmware crashes when we receive a null!  There's a missing
;	    "SEX SP" in VTPUTC.
;
; 022	-- Serial interrupts always set the UART to 8N1 when clearing the TR
;	    bit.  Remember the actual format in SLUFMT and use that instead.
;
; 023	-- Implement TXSBRK and make the terminal emulator transmit a serial
;	    break with the PS/2 BREAK key is pressed.
;
; 024	-- Make the PS/2 MENU key exit from terminal emulation and start the
;	    command scanner.  This works in any mode.
;
; 025	-- Fill the part of the screen after the last displayed character with
;	    i8275 "end of screen stop DMA" control codes.  This helps stop
; 	    screen flicker when there's a lot of serial port interrupts.
;
; 026	-- If flow control is used, SERCLR needs to enable the other end (by
;	    setting CTS or sending an XON).
;
; 027	-- NORMA1 shouldn't do an ANI $7F because WFAC needs it to write field
;	    attribute codes to the screen!
;
; 028	-- Change the default timing for a 14.318MHz pixel clock to use 9 pixels
;           per glyph and to generate 25 rows of text.
;
; 029	-- The 8275 datasheet contains this tidbit - "If the line number of the
;	    underline is greater than 7, then the top and bottom scan lines will
;	    be blanked."  I've no idea what this is good for, but apparently the
;	    8275 really does this.  That means if we have 9 or 10 scan lines per
;	    glyph and we try to put the underline on line 9 or 10, we lose two
;	    rows off our glyphs!  For 9 scanlines per character row and 8 lines
;	    per glyph, that's unbearable!  So change the the underline line to
;	    the middle of the row and call it a strike thru instead!
;
; 030	-- Add a demo of the line drawing functions to the splash screen.
;
; 031	-- Remove CPU clock restrictions, calculate the needed constants.
;
; 032	-- Move screen buffer to top of memory to simplify test for wrap.
;
; 033	-- Remove FRAME counter not being used. UPDATE is the same thing.
;
; 034	-- Check for end of screen and reset the DMAPTR if needed in the
;	     middle of the serial ISR between receive and transmit.
;
; 035	-- Remove DMA burst space to stop flicker. Allow interrupts while
;	     scrolling and speed up scrolling. Reduce time interrupts
;	     disabled in LDCURS. Streamline serial receive and buffer
;	     handling, remove buffer count variable.
;
; 036	-- Fix SCRDWN to erase the correct line. Fix DMA burst setting.
;
; 037	-- Speed improvement in main terminal loop and enable interrupt
;            during cursor load.
;
; 038	-- Add assembly options (CPUCLOCK, PIXELCLOCK, and GLYPHWIDTH) to
;	    splash screen.
;
; 039	-- Align LINTAB to speed up access in critical path. Rewrite the
;	     normal (regular printable) character handling routine to speed
;	     up termianl output.
;
; 040	-- Change LINTAB to LSB first to make arithmetic easier. Remove a
;	     few cycles from EOF ISR. Don't update cursor location when it is
;	     hidden anyway. Separate out core of VTPUTC so that terminal
;	     can skip save and restore of registers.
;
; 041	-- Don't check framing error on UART unless DA is set as it only
;	     changes when a character is received. Cleanup VTPUTT a little.
;	     Make ISR handle multiple events per invocation to reduce latency
;	     and overhead when interrupts happen during interrupts.
;
; 042	-- Major restructuring around the termainal main loop and subroutine
;	     calls for the basic I/O functions, adapting a quick call scheme
;	     for those time critical things. Changed the jump tables from
;	     plain addresses to LBR instructions to avoid need for SEP stuff.
;	     Other changes and restructuring to support this.
;
;--
VEREDT	.EQU	42	; and the edit level
;
; TODO list-
;   Drawing boxes and lines should be easier - maybe some kind of escape
; sequences with (column,row) coordinates for endpoints?
;
;   Still have some annoying flicker when scrolling.  Why?  Is it just
; interrupt latency for the end of row screen wrap around?
;
;   Need escape sequences for playing tones and music (should be compatible
; with the VIS1802!).
;
;   Use some extra RAM (we have lots!) to implement a second text display
; page.  Direct the terminal output to one page and the BASIC output to the
; other, and then use some PS/2 key to flip between them.  
;
;  Implement some simple POST diagnostics at startup?
;
;  Add auto newline <ESC>v and w.
;
;  Distinguish between auto new line and auto line wrap?
;
;  Cleanup the startup code and remove some of the junk commands.
;
;  Expect an 1805 CPU and try to speed up the code by replacing the macros
;    with built-in 1805 instructions, especially RLDI, DBNZ, SCAL, SRET, etc.
;    SCAL/SRET may be problematic with BASIC3...

MAXCOL	   .EQU	80	; characters displayed per row
CURSORTYPE .EQU  0	; 0->blinking block, 1->blinking underline
			; 2->non-blinking block, 3->non-blinking underline

;   These are the video timing parameters for a 14.31818MHz dot clock, 8 pixels
; per glyph, and an 80x26 display.  This setup gives longer retrace times and
; works better with older, analog, CVBS monitors.  For this timing, set
; MAXROW=26 and HRTCCNT=32.
;
;   The "alternate" 14.31818MHz timing uses 9 pixels per glyph and gives an
; 80x25 display.  This gives a better looking display (more space between the)
; characters) but may not be enough horizontal retrace time for some monitors.
	.IF PIXELCLOCK == 14318180

;   These are the timing parameters for a 12.000MHz dot clock, 8 pixels per
; glyph, and an 80x24 display.  This gives shorter retrace times, but larger
; characters and fills more of the the screen for a real CGA type monitor.
;
;   And like before, there is an "alternate" 12MHz timing that uses 7 pixels
; per glyph for an 80x25 display. This gives very squished together characters,
; but it does give more overscan and longer retrace times.

;++
;   Thexe are the circular buffers used by the interrupt service routines.
; All in all, there are three such buffers -
;
;	TXBUF	- characters waiting to be transmitted via the serial port
;	RXBUF	- characters received from the serial port
;	KEYBUF	- data received from the PS/2 keyboard
;
;   One might ask why we need a KEYBUF, because a) data received from the
; keyboard goes directly to the serial port TXBUF, and b) the PS/2 APU chip has
; a built in buffer anyway.  It's because we want to be able to "look ahead"
; and detect keys like MENU, SETUP or BREAK when running BASIC (or perhaps when
; the UART is transmitting at a slow baud rate).
;
;   IMPORTANT!   To make life and coding easier, and faster for the ISRs, on
; the 1802 (which is not the smartest MCU around, after all) these buffers
; have several restrictions!
;
;   1) The ??GETP and ??PUTP pointers are indices, relative to the buffer
;      base, of the next character for the GET and PUT routines, respectively.
;      If the GETP equals the PUTP before a GET then the buffer is empty, and
;      if after incrementing the PUTP it would equal the GETP for a GET, then
;      the buffer is full!
;
;   2) Buffer sizes must always be a power of two, and not more than 256.  So
;      16, 32, 64, 128 or 256 are the only practical and reasonable sizes.
;      This allows us to handle GETP/PUTP wrap around with a simple AND.
;
;   3) The actual buffers must be aligned on a natural boundary; for example,
;      a 64 byte buffer must be aligned on a 64 byte boundary (i.e. such that
;      the lower 6 bits of the buffer address are zeros).  This allows us to
;      index into the buffer without having to worry about carry operations.
;
;   4) The order of the GETP/PUTP pointers for each buffer can't change.
;      It's always GET pointer first, then PUT pointer.
;
;   5) The RAM initialization code in the startup sets all these values to
;      zero.  For the GET/PUT pointers, that's an empty buffer (perfect!).

	.SBTTL	Lookup and Dispatch Command Verbs

;++
;   This routine is called with P1 pointing to the first letter of a command
; (usually the first thing in the command buffer) and P2 pointing to a table
; of commands.  It searches the command table for a command that matches the
; command line and, if it finds one, dispatches to the correct action routine.
;
;   Commands can be any number of characters (not necessarily even letters)
; and may be abbreviated to a minimum length specified in the command table.
; For example, "BA", "BAS", "BASI" and "BASIC" are all valid for the "BASIC"
; command, however "BASEBALL" is not.

	.SBTTL	XMODEM Load and Save

;++
;   The XSAVE command uploads a chunk of memory to the host as a binary "file"
; using the XMODEM protocol, and the XLOAD command downloads the same to RAM.
; XMODEM does have flow control, checksums, error detection and (best of all)
; error correction, which are all good.  Unlike Intel HEX files however, it
; does NOT have any kind of address information so it's up to you to make sure
; that any binary file is loaded into RAM at the right address!
;
;	>>>XSAVE bbbb eeee
; 	- or -
;	>>>XLOAD bbbb eeee
;
; where "bbbb" and "eeee" are the addresses of the first and last bytes to be
; saved or loaded (similar to the EXAMINE command).
;
;   XMODEM always saves data in 128 byte blocks so for XSAVE if the size of the
; block to be saved is not a multiple of 128, then the last record will be
; padded with SUB ($1A, Control-Z) bytes.  That's the XMODEM tradition.  For
; XLOAD, if the host sends more data than the specified address range allows,
; the extra data will be ignored.  That means that as long as XSAVE and XLOAD
; have the same parameters, the extra SUB bytes will be ignored.

	.SBTTL	Load Intel HEX Records

;   This routine will parse an Intel .HEX file record from the command line and,
; if the record is valid, deposit it in memory.  All Intel .HEX records start
; with a ":", and the command scanner just funnels all lines that start that
; way to here.  This means you can just send a .HEX file to the SBC1802 thru
; your terminal emulator, and there's no need for a special command to download
; it.  And since each Intel .HEX record ends with a checksum, error checking
; is automatic.
;
;   Intel .HEX records look like this -
;
;	>>>:bbaaaattdddddddddddd......ddcc
;
; Where
;
;	bb   is the count of data bytes in this record
;	aaaa is the memory address for the first data byte
;	tt   is the record type (00 -> data, 01 -> EOF)
;	dd   is zero or more bytes of data
;	cc   is the record checksum
;
;   All values are either two, or in the case of the address, four hex digits.
; All fields are fixed length and no spaces or characters other than hex digits
; (excepting the ":" of course) are allowed.
;
;   While this code is running, the following registers are used -
;
;	P1   - pointer to CMDBUF (contains the HEX record)
;	P2   - hex byte/word returned by GHEX2/GHEX4
;	P3   - memory address (from the aaaa field in the record)
;	T1.0 - record length (from the bb field)
;	T1.1 - record type (from the tt field)
;	T2.0 - checksum accumulator (8 bits only!)
;	T2.1 - temporary used by GHEX2/GHEX4
;
;   Lastly, note that when we get here the ":" has already been parsed, and
; P1 points to the first character of the "bb" field.

;   These routines are used specifically to read Intel .HEX records.  We can't
; call the usual HEXNW, et al, functions here since they need a delimiter to
; stop scanning.  Calling HEXNW would just eat the entire remainder of the
; .HEX record and return only the last 16 bits!  So instead we have two special

;   This routine will read a four digit hex number pointed to by P1 and return
; its value in P3.  Other than a doubling of precision, it's exactly the same

;   This routine will scan a two hex number pointed to by P1 and return its

; in this case the number must contain exactly two digits - no more, and no
; less.  If we don't find two hex digits in the string addressed by P1, the

; the stack.  The return at the end of the subroutine is then simply:
;
;	IRX\ LDX\ PLO PC
;
; As can be seen, this only takes eleven machine cycles versus the 66 cycles
; that standard call costs, but obviously with limitations, including that
; the subroutine must return from the same page it was called from. This is
; accomplished by a return stub that can be jumped to.
;
; To hide a little bit of this, macros have been created for the above:
;
;	QCALL(SUBR)
;	QRETURN
;
; Since D is used to pass the return address, and destroyed on return, it
; can't be used to pass values, so will will generally do that in AUX.1 when
; single-byte arguments are used.
;
; For the cases where a function needs to be used through standard call,
; there is a simple wrapper around the quick call to save registers and 
; change argument passing between AUX and D as needed.

;	RC (aka P3) = byte count
;
;   One thing - when somebody eventually tries to load this data back into

; bytes to the start of the data to save the address and byte count.  We do
; this by pushing those registers onto the stack and then saving four bytes
; directly from the stack area, which is slightly clever but works great.

; P1 for PLAY.  On return PLAY leaves P1 pointing to the first character that

	.SBTTL	Direct Cursor Addressing

;++
;   This routine implements the direct cursor addressing escape sequence.  The
; <ESC>Y sequence is followed by two data bytes which indicate the line and
; column (in that order) that the cursor is to move to. Both values are biased
; by 32 so that they are appear as printing ASCII characters.  The line number
; character should be in the range 32 to 55 (decimal), and the column number
; character may range from 32 to 112 (decimal).  If either byte is out of
; range, then the cursor will only move as far as the margin.
;
;   For example:
;	<ESC>Y<SP><SP>	- move to (0,0) (i.e. home)
;	<ESC>Y7o	- move to (79,23) (i.e. lower right)
;--

; Here for part 1 - <ESC>Y has been received so far...
DIRECT: LDI EYNEXT\ LBR ESCNXT	; next state is get Y

; Part 2 - the current character is Y, save it and wait for X...
DIRECY: RLDI(T1,CURCHR)		; get the current character
	LDA T1\ STR T1		; load CURCHR, save in SAVCHR
	LDI EXNEXT\ LBR ESCNXT	; next state is "get X"

; Part 3 - CURCHR is X and SAVCHR is Y.
DIRECX: RLDI(T1,CURCHR)		; point T1 at CURCHR/SAVCHR
	RLDI(T2,CURSX)		; and T2 at CURSX/CURSY

;  First handle the X coordinate.  Remember that the cursor moves to the
; corresponding margin if the coordinate give is less than 0 or greater than
; MAXCOL-1!
	LDN T1\ SMI ' '		; get X and adjust for the ASCII bias
	LBGE	DIREC1		; branch if greater than zero
	LDI 0\ LBR DIRE12	; less than zero - use zero instead
DIREC1:	SMI MAXCOL\ LBNF DIRE11	; would it be greater than MAXCOL-1?
	LDI MAXCOL-1\ LBR DIRE12; yes - just use MAXCOL-1 instead
DIRE11:	LDN T1\ SMI ' '		; the original coordinate is OK
DIRE12:	STR	T2		; and update CURSX

; Now handle the Y coordinate (in SAVCHR) the same way...
	INC T1\ INC T2		; point to CURSY
	LDN T1\ SMI ' '		; pretty much the same as before
	LBGE	DIREC2		; branch if greater than zero
	LDI 0\ LBR DIRE22	; nope - use zero instead
DIREC2:	SMI MAXROW\ LBNF DIRE21	; is it too big for the screen?
	LDI MAXROW-1\ LBR DIRE22; yes - use the bottom margin instead
DIRE21:	LDN T1\ SMI ' '		; the value is OK - get it back again
DIRE22:	STR	T2		; and update CURSY

;   Finally, update the cursor on the screen and we're done.  DON'T FORGET to
; change the next state (ESCSTA) to zero to mark the end of this sequence!
	LDI 0\ CALL(ESCSET)	; next state is zero (back to normal)
	LBR LDCURS

	.SBTTL	Select Graphics, Reverse Video and Alternate Keypad

;++
;   On the VT52, the <ESC>F command selects the alternate character set, and
; the <ESC>G command deselects it.  The SI (Shift In) and SO (Shift Out)
; control characters do the same...

; Enable the alternate character set...
ENAACS:	RLDI(T1,ACSMOD)		; point to the ACS mode flag

; Disable the alternate character set...
DSAACS:	RLDI(T1,ACSMOD)		; same as before

	LBR SHRET		; ...


;++
;   The sequence <ESC>r selects reverse video.  It's exactly the same as the

;--
ENARVV:	LDI 'P'\ LBR WFAC2	; store the reverse video attribute


;++
;   And the sequence <ESC>n selects normal video and is equivalent to the
; sequence <ESC>N@.  This too is for compatability with the VIS1802.
;--
DSARVV:	LDI '@'\ LBR WFAC2	; store the normal video attribute


;++
;   The sequence <ESC> = slects alternate keypad mode, and <ESC> > selects
; normal (numeric) keypad mode ...
;--

; Select alternate keypad mode ...
ALTKPD:	RLDI(T1,KPDALT)		; point to the alternate keypad mode flag
	LDI $FF\ STR T1		; and make it non-zero for alternate mode
	LBR SHRET		; ...

; Select numeric keypad mode ...
NUMKPD:	RLDI(T1,KPDALT)		; same as above!
	LDI $00\ STR T1		; but set it to zero for numeric keypad mode
	LBR SHRET		; ...

	.SBTTL	Write Field Attribute Code

;++
;   This routine is called to processes the Write Field Attribute escape
; sequence.  The <ESC>N sequence is followed by a single parameter byte, the
; the lower 6 bits of which are written to screen memory as an 8275 field
; attribute code (refer to the 8275 data sheet for more information).  The
; 8275 is set up in non-transparent attribute mode, so each attribute byte
; requires a character location on the screen (which is blanked by the VSP
; output).
;
;   This allows us to get blinking, reverse video, and strikethru, as well
; as select any one of four alternate character sets stored in the EPROM.
; Needless to say, the VT52 didn't have this function!
;
;   Sequence	Attribute
;   --------	------------
;   <ESC>N@	Normal video
;   <ESC>NA	highlight (bold)
;   <ESC>NB	blinking
;   <ESC>NH	alternate font 1 (GPA1)
;   <ESC>ND	alternate font 2 (GPA2)
;   <ESC>NL	alternate font 3 (GPA3)
;   <ESC>NP	reverse video
;   <ESC>N 	strikethru (<ESC>N space!, 0x1B 0x4E 0x20)
;
;   Note that attributes can be combined by ORing the bit patterns.  For
; example, <ESC>NC gives bold blinking, or <ESC>N" gives strikethru blinking.
; Also the special code <ESC>r is equivalent to <ESC>NP and selects reverse
; video.  Likewise <ESC>n is equivalent to <ESC>N@ and selects normal video.
; These two codes are implemented for compatability with the VIS1802.
;
;   And one last comment - if you're wondering why font 1 is <ESC>NH and font 2
; is <ESC>ND when it seems like they should be reversed, it's because there's
; an error in the VT1802 PCB and GPA1 is connected to A11 and GPA0 to A12.
; That swaps the codes for 1 and 2.
;--
WFAC:	LDI EANEXT\ LBR ESCNXT	; wait for the field attribute code

; Here when we receive the next byte...
WFAC1:	LDI 0\ CALL(ESCSET)	; first, set ESCSTA to zero

	RLDI(T1,TOPLIN)		; point to top line of screen
	LBR	NORMA1		; and then go store it in screen memory

	.SBTTL	Write Line Drawing Code

;++
;   The <ESC>l sequence writes an i8275 line drawing attribute code to the
; screen memory.  The <ESC>l should be followed by a single character that
; specifies the line segment to be drawn, according to this list -
;
;   Sequence	Line
;   --------	------------
;   <ESC>l@	top left corner
;   <ESC>lD	top right corner
;   <ESC>lH	bottom left corner
;   <ESC>lL	bottom right corner
;   <ESC>lP	top intersect
;   <ESC>lT	right intersect
;   <ESC>lX	left intersect
;   <ESC>l\	bottom intersect
;   <ESC>l`	horizontal line
;   <ESC>ld	vertical line
;   <ESC>lh	crossed lines
;
;   Notice that, like the field attribute codes, the lower six bits of the
; character are simply the line drawing code that gets written to memory.
;--
WLINE:	LDI ELNEXT\ LBR ESCNXT	; wait for the line drawing code

; Here when we receive the next byte ...
WLINE1:	LDI 0\ CALL(ESCSET)	; end of escape sequence

	.SBTTL	Identify (Answerback) Function

	.SBTTL	Raster Test

;++
;   This routine will implement the raster test escape sequence.  The <ESC>Q

	.SBTTL	Basic Cursor Motions

;++

; upper left corner of the screen.  Nothing else changes, and no characters
; on the screen are altered.
;--

	LDI 0\ STR T1		; set both CURSX and CURSY to zero
	INC T1\ STR T1		; ...
	LBR	LDCURS		; then let the user see the change


;++
;   This routine will implement the cursor left function. This will move the
; cursor left one character. If, however, the cursor is already against the
; left  margin of the screen, then no action occurs.
;--
LEFT:	RLDI(T1,CURSX)		; get the cursor column number
	LDN T1\ SMI 1		; and move it left one space
	LBNF	CURRET		; return now if the result is .LT. 0
	STR	T1		; no -- change the software location
	LBR	LDCURS		; and go change the picture on the screen


;++
;   This routine will implement the cursor right function. This will move the
; cursor right one character. If, however, the cursor is already against the
; right margin of the screen, then no action occurs.
;--
RIGHT:	RLDI(T1,CURSX) 		; get the cursor X location
	LDN T1\ XRI MAXCOL-1	; don't allow it to move past this
	LBZ	CURRET		; already at the right margin - quit now
RIGHT1:	LDN T1\ ADI 1\ STR T1	; nope - its safe to increment the cursor
	LBR	LDCURS		; and tell the 8275 about the change


;++
;   This routine will implement the cursor up function.  This will move the
; cursor up one character line. If, however, the cursor is already at the top
; of the screen, then no action occurs.
;--
UP:	RLDI(T1,CURSY)		; get the row which contains the cursor
	LDN T1\ SMI 1		; and move it up one character row
	LBNF	CURRET		; return now if the new position is .LT. 0
	STR	T1		; no -- change the virtual location
	LBR	LDCURS		; and change the picture


;++
;   This routine will implement the cursor down function. This will move the
; cursor down one character line. If, however, the cursor is already at the

	.SBTTL	Cursor Functions

;++
;   This routine will update the 8275 cursor location so that it agrees with
; the software location.  This is called after most cursor motion functions
; to actually change the picture on the screen...  Uses (but doesn't save) T1!
;
;   If the VISCUR flag is zero, then the cursor display is "hidden" and
; you don't see a cursor on the screen.  The cursor has already been hidden
; in this case by moving it to an off-screen address, we just need to not
; reset it so it stays hidden.
;--
LDCURS:	RLDI(T1,VISCUR)\ LDN T1	; is the cursor hidden ?
	LBZ LDCUR2		; yes -- nothing to do then

; Here to show the real cursor ...
LDCUR1:	SEX T1
	OUT CRTCMD		; give the load cursor command
	OUT CRTPRM		; and output X ...
	OUT CRTPRM		; ... and then Y
LDCUR2:	LBR SPRET		; ... and return

;++
;   This subroutine will compute the actual address of the character under the
; cursor.  This address depends on the cursor location (obviously) and also
; the value of TOPLIN (which represents the number of the top line on the
; screen after scrolling).  The address computed is returned in P1.
;--
WHERE:	RLDI(T1,TOPLIN)\ LDA T1	; get TOPLIN first
	INC T1\ INC T1		; move to CURSY
	SEX T1\ ADD		; compute TOPLIN+CURSY
	CALL(LINADD)		; set P1 = address of the cursor line

	GLO P1\ SEX T1\ ADD	; and add CURSX
	PLO	P1		; put it back
	GHI P1\ ADCI 0\ PHI P1	; and propagate the carry
CURRET:	RETURN			; leave the address in P1 and we're done...


;++
;   The <ESC>h sequence will disable display of the cursor.  The cursor still
; exists as far as the software is concerned, and all the functions that are
; relative to the current cursor position work normally.  All this does is make
; the blinking block disappear from the screen.
;
;   The i8275 doesn't actually have a way to hide or disable the display of
; the cursor, so what we do here is set the cursor to a location that is off
; of the screen, and zero the VISCURS byte so that LDCURS knows not to set
; the location any more since that would unhide it.
;--
DSACURS:RLDI(T1,VISCUR)	; point to the cursor display flag

	LBR LDCUR1		; and display the cursor

	.SBTTL	Compute the Address of Any Line

;++
;   This subroutine will calculate the address of any line on the screen.
; The absolute number of the line (i.e. not relative to any scrolling) should
; be passed in the D and the resulting address is returned in P1...  Uses
; (but doesn't save!) T1...
;--

	LDA T1\ PLO P1		; that's the line address
	LDN T1\ PHI P1		; ...
	RETURN			; and then that's all there is to do

;++
;   This table is used to translate character row numbers into actual screen
; buffer addresses.  It is indexed by twice the row number (0, 2, 4, ... 48) and
; contains the corresponding RAM address of that line, least significant byte
; first, as this aids with arithmetic as we can do LSB first with LDA.
;
;   This table is page aligned so that the LSB of the first entry starts the
; page, this saves having to add one later. Also, the table repeats twice
; so that we can add TOPLIN and CURSY and use it directly as an index without
; wrapping the value around; the modulo operation is built into the table.
;
;   Needless to say, it should have at least MAXROW (times two) entries!
; Note that some display modes have as many as 26 displayed lines.

; generator on the VT1802 - all we have to do is turn it on (easy) and then
; turn it off again in a little bit (harder!).  To arrange for the speaker
; to be turned off, we set the location TTIMER to a non-zero value.  When ever
; TTIMER is non-zero the end of video frame ISR will decrement the counter
; and, when TTIMER makes the 1->0 transition, turns off the speaker.

	.SBTTL	Initialize i8275 Display

;++
;   This routine will initialize the 8275 CRT controller.  It sends a RESET
; command to the 8275 followed by four parameter bytes which set the format,
; timing, cursor type, etc for the display.  After this, the 8275 will be in
; a known state and it will be stopped (i.e. no DMA and no interrupt requests)
; until we issue a START DISPLAY command.
;
;   BTW, the 8275 chip has a really nasty issue because it lacks any kind of
; RESET or CLEAR input.  When we power up the 8275 can be in any state and
; doing anything.  Worse, after a RESET the 8275 will just blindly continue
; doing whatever it was before.  This is a real problem for the CDP1802, since
; it has no way to inhibit DMA requests AND it uses PC0/DMAPTR after reset!
;
;   To fix this, the VT1802 hardware implements a simple "DISPLAY ON" flip
; flop that's cleared by a RESET/power up.  This inhibits 8275 DMA, interrupts
; and the horizontal and vertical sync outputs to the monitor.  The DISPLAY
; ON flip flop is set, and video is enabled, the first time we read the 8275
; status register.

	.SBTTL	Music Notation

;++
;   The music player takes an ordinary ASCII string and interprets it as
; a musical notation of sorts.  The letters A..G (or a..g, since case is
; ignored) refer to the notes A thru G.  Each letter may be followed by a
; "+" or "#" to indicate a sharp, or a "-" to indicate a flat. "DABF#GDGA"
; would get you the famous 8 note cello part from Pachelbel's Canon.
;
;   Other characters have special meanings as well.  The digits 1, 2, 4 or
; 8 specify the note duration - whole note, half note, quarter note or eighth
; note (notice that larger numbers are shorter intervals!).  Sixteenth notes
; are unfortunately not possible - sorry!  The note duration must preceed the
; note ("4D" for a quarter note D, NOT "D4"!) and remain in effect until
; changed by another digit.  So the string "4DABF" would be ALL quarter notes.
;
;   The "," indicates a rest of the same duration as the current note (e.g.
; "1," is a whole rest.  A ">" shifts all notes up one octave and "<" shifts
; all notes down one octave.  The player has an overal range of four octaves,
; from one octave below middle C to two octaves above, and attempts to shift
; above or below this range will be ignored.  There is no way to absolutely
; set the current octave, however something like "<<<<>" would select the
; octave of middle C.
;
;   Spaces in the string are ignored, and playing terminates when any illegal
; character, including EOS ('\0'), is encountered.  
;
;   Summary -
;	A, B, C, D, E, F, G - a note to play
;	# or +, -	    - sharp or flat (place AFTER note!)
;	1, 2, 4, 8	    - note length (whole, half, quarter, eighth)
;	>, <		    - shift up or down one octave
;	,		    - rest (silence)
;	<space>		    - ignored
;
;   Note that by tradition a quarter note lasts one beat, so a whole note is
; 4 beats, a half note is 2 beats, and an eighth note is 1/2 beat.   Yeah,
; it would have been better to start at the eighth note, but I don't make the
; rules!  If the tempo is, say 60 beats per minute, then a quarter note is
; 1 second and a whole note 4 seconds.  Given that we count note times in
; 60Hz VRTC interrupts, at 60 BPM a whole note would be 240 ticks which is
; about the longest count we can fit into one byte.  That makes the slowest
; possible tempo about 60 BPM, which turns out to be pretty reasonable for
; most music.

;++
;   This routine will examine the character pointed to by P1 and if it's one
; of the letters A..G then it will start playing that note and return with
; DF=0.  If the character is a ',', then we play a "rest" - this is just like
; a note, except that the tone generator is turned off.  If it's NOT a letter
; A..G or comma then we'll leave P1 unchanged and return with DF=1.
;
;   If it is a letter, A..G, then we advance P1 and look ahead at the next
; character to see if that's a "+" or "#" for a sharp, or "-" for a flat.
; If either of those are found then we move up or down one step in the note
; table and advance P1 past the +/#/- too.  Needless to say, sharps and flats
; don't apply to rests (commas).
;
;   IMPORTANT - our note table covers only one octave, from C to B.  A C-
; (C flat) requires us to shift down one octave and then play a B.  Likewise,
; a B# requires us to shift up an octave and then play C.  We can actually
; do that, but the octave shift will not be undone when the note finishes!

	.SBTTL	Note Divisors for The CDP1863

;++
;   The table at NOTES gives the name (as an ASCII character) and the
; corresponding divider for the CDP1863.  The sharps and flats have 80H added
; to the ASCII character - this ensures that they will NEVER match when the
; table is searched.  The code handles sharps and flats by finding the letter
; first and then adding or subtracting one table entry.
;
;   Note that in the VT1802 the CDP1863 is clocked by TPB from the 1802, and
; that means that the divisors depend on the CPU clock frequency.  It would
; have been nice to used a fixed frequency here, such as the baud rate clock,
; but that would have required another couple of flip flops to divide it down
; to the range to give audio frequencies.
;
;   The following tables of note divisors are calculated from the CPU clock
; in Hertz, taking into account the pre-scaling of 8 from TPB, and 16 internal
; to the CDP1863. This gives a ratio of 1/128 which is expressed in the
; formula as 1/64 x 1/2 to make it easy to round the result.
;
; Note frequencies for octave = 3...

	.SBTTL	Interrupt Service Routine

;++
;   This is the CDP1802 interrupt service routine, and in the VT1802 it gets
; called for any one of four conditions - END OF ROW, END OF FRAME, SERIAL
; PORT, or KEYBOARD.  The serial port and keyboard interrupts are pretty self
; explanatory.  The END OF FRAME interrupt is generated by the 8275 at the
; start of the vertical retrace interval; for NTSC this occurs at 60Hz, or
; once every 16.66ms.
;
;   The END OF ROW interrupts are generated by the VT1802 hardware each time
; the 8275 finishes the DMA transfer for one row of characters.  We need this
; because at every row end we have to check the DMA pointer to see if it's
; reached the end of the screen buffer and, if it has, reset it back to the
; top.  This screen buffer wrap around is necessary for scrolling.
;--

	PAGE	; start new page before ISRs to ensure short branch reach

;++
;   We are able to process multiple interrupt sources per interrupt, which
; avoids overhead of saving and restoring registers when multiple interrupts
; occur simultaneously, or more likely, when a second interruptable event
; happens while we are already in an interrupt handler.
;
;   When an interrupt service routine is finished, it branches back to here
; where we test for additional interrupts. If one is present, we dispatch
; immediately to a "quick" entry point which does not re-save the T1 register
; since we have also not restored it yet. Only when there are no more sources
; pending do we restore T1 and other other registers and return.
;
;   While it's not possible to test for an end-of-row interrupt on an initial
; interrupt assertion, if one happens while we are already in the interrupt
; service routine, then we can test with EF4, because an S3 cycle will not
; have happened to acknowledge it yet. We can also quickly acknowledge the
; interrupt and clear the hardware flip-flop by executing a RET instruction,
; which will return from interupt and then immediately re-enter, triggering
; an S3 cycle. No foreground instructions will execute in-between so we do
; not need to save anything and in fact it's irrelevant what X,P we restore.

;++
;   Here's the interrupt service routine.  When we get here we can assume that
; P=1 and X=2 (the SP).  We need to save T (which contains the old X,P), and
; then D, DF and finally T1.  After that, figure out what caused the interrupt
; and dispatch to some code to handle it.  Note that it's a common 1802 coding
; technique to use M(SP) as a temporary, so we must decrement SP before saving
; anything on the stack to protect any temporary data that the background may
; have there.  
;
;   Note that END OF ROW interrupts occur MAXROW times per frame, about once
; every 640 microseconds!  That's pretty often, especially for a slow witted 
; 1802, so the following ISR code is optimized for that case.  All the other
; interrupts are much less frequent and we can afford to be a bit more lazy
; with them.

ISR:	DEC SP\ SAV		; push T (the saved X,P)

;++
;   You might think that we could test for an END OF ROW interrupt by checking
; EF4 with the B4, B_ROWIRQ, instruction, but no - that doesn't work.  That's
; because the hardware automatically clears the ROW END flag with the CDP1802
; INTACK cycle occurs, so by the time we get here the flag has gone away.
;
;   Another problem is that an END OF ROW interrupt might occur simultaneously
; with a different interrupt, say serial port or keyboard.  If we test for those
; interrupt sources first and exit w/o servicing the END OF ROW, then this will
; be lost and the screen will glitch.
;
;   The only safe bet is to check the DMA pointer to see if it's reached the
; end of the screen buffer after EVERY interrupt.  If the DMA pointer has hit
; the end of the screen, wrap it around to the start of the screen buffer.
; The scrolling depends on this, and it's the reason why we need interrupts at
; the end of each row...

;   Transmit a break on the serial port by setting the FORCE BREAK bit in the
; CDP1854 control register.  This will force the UART's TXD output low to
; transmit a space condition for as long as the force break bit is set.
; To be detected by the other end we have to remain in this condition for at
; least as long as one character time.  A shorter time may not work, but longer
; does no harm (except to slow things down).
;
;   The way you time this with most UARTs is to set the force break bit and
; then transmit some arbitrary data byte.  The byte never actually gets sent
; (because TXD is held low) but the shift register timing still works and we
; can simply wait for that to finish.  Unfortunately, this DOESN'T WORK with
; the CDP1854!  The 1854 freezes the transmitter entirely while the force
; break bit is set, and nothing will happen with the transmitter status as
; long as it is.
;
;   So we're stuck with timing the interval manually, and we have to be sure
; that it's longer than the time it would take to transmit one byte at the
; slowest baud rate we support.  Worse, once we clear the force break bit,
; the CDP1854 needs us to transmit a byte, which will be turned into garbage
; by the other end since there will be no start bit, to finally and completely

;++
;   These routines will transmit an arbitrary block of RAM, using the XMODEM
; protocol up to the host over the serial port.  And they'll also download an
; arbitrary block of RAM from the host using XMODEM in a similar way.  The
; basic plan for uploading RAM is -
;
;   1) Call XOPENW, which will wait for the host to send us a NAK, indicating
;   that it is ready to receive data.
;
;   2) Call XWRITE to transmit a block of RAM.  Note that XMODEM data blocks
;   are always 128 bytes, however you can call XWRITE with any arbitrary sized
;   chunk of RAM and XWRITE will handle reblocking it.  Also note that you may
;   call XWRITE more than once, for contiguous or discontiguous blocks of RAM,
;   however remember that the addresses and byte counts are NOT transmitted.
;   Only the raw data is saved, so if you want to later download the same file
;   you are responsible for getting everything back in the right spot.
;
;   3) When you're done, call XCLOSEW.  This will transmit any partial XMODEM
;   block remaining and then send an EOT to the host, telling it that we're
;   done.  Note that XMODEM blocks are always 128 bytes, and by tradition any
;   partial block at the end is padded with SUB ($1A, Control-Z) characters.
;
; Downloading a file to RAM goes basically the same way -
;
;   1) Call XOPENR. This will send a NAK to the host, after a short delay,
;   and it should start sending us data.
;
;   2) Call XREAD one or more times to read data from the host.  Once again
;   you can read any arbitrary number of bytes with XREAD, and it will handle
;   reblocking into 180 byte chunks but remember that you're responsible for
;   getting everything back in the right RAM locations.
;
;   3) Call XCLOSER to wait for the host to send EOT, indicating the end of
;   file.  Note that any additional data the host may send while XCLOSER is
;   waiting for EOT will be ignored.
;
;   The XMODEM code uses 132 bytes of RAM for a temporary buffer.  THIS PART 
; OF RAM CANNOT BE UPLOADED OR DOWNLOADED!

;   This routine will transmit a block of RAM to the host via XMODEM.  P3
; should contain a pointer to the start of the data, and P2 should contain
; a count of the bytes to send.  XMODEM naturally sends data in 128 byte
; byte blocks and this routine will automatically handle reblocking the
; original data, regardless of its actual length.  
;
;   If the data length is not a multiple of 128, meaning that the last XMODEM
; record is partially filled, then data data remains in the XBUFFER.  If this
; routine is called a second time then that additional data is simply appended
; to what's already in the XBUFFER.  If not, then you must call XCLOSEW to
; pad out and transmit the final record.
;
;   Note that at the moment there isn't any error detection or correction
; here.  About the only thing that could go wrong is that we time out waiting
; for the host to respond, or that we get in an infinite retransmit loop.

	.SBTTL	Standard Call and Return Technique

;++
;   These two routines implement the "standard call and return tecnhique", more
; or less right out of the RCA manual.  All assume the following register usage
;
;	R2 (SP)     - stack pointer (1802 stacks grow DOWNWARD!)
;	R3 (PC)     - program counter
;	R4 (CALLPC) - always points to the SCALL routine
;	R5 (RETPC)  - always points to the SRETURN routine
;	R6 (A)	    - subroutine argument list pointer
;
;   A subroutine call goes like this -
;
;	SEP	CALLPC
;	.WORD	<address of subroutine>
;	<any arguments, if desired>
;
; The SCALL routine first pushes the current argument pointer, register R6/A,
; onto the stack.  It then copies the R3/PC, which is the caller's PC to the
; A register.  Next it uses A to fetch the two bytes following the SEP CALLPC,
; which are the address of the subroutine, and load them into the PC register.
; Finally it switches the P register back to R3/PC and the called subroutine
; is running.  The subroutine may use the A register to fetch additional inline
; arguments if desired, being sure to increment A as it does.  
;
;  When the subroutine wants to return it executes a
;
;	SEP	RETPC
;
; This starts the SRETURN routine running, which copies the current A register
; back to the PC, and then pops the previous A value from the stack.  Lastly
; it switches the P register back to R3 and we're back at the caller's location.
